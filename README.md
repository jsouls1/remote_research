## ‚ùì What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is like a universal adapter for AI applications. It provides a standardized way for AI models to connect with various tools and data sources, enabling them to access and utilize external information seamlessly. Think of it as a "USB port" for AI, allowing easy plug-and-play integration with different resources.

## üí° Why Use MCP?

Traditionally, integrating AI models with external data sources required custom solutions for each case, leading to complexity and redundancy. MCP addresses this by offering:([PromptLayer][1])

* **Standardization**: A unified protocol for connecting AI models to various tools and data sources.
* **Flexibility**: Support for multiple programming languages and platforms.
* **Scalability**: Easier expansion and maintenance of AI applications.([Model Context Protocol][2], [DeepLearning.ai][3])

## üèóÔ∏è MCP Architecture Explained

MCP operates on a client-server architecture comprising three main components:([Medium][4])

1. **Host Process**: The AI-powered application or environment (e.g., Claude Desktop) that users interact with.
2. **MCP Clients**: Intermediaries that handle communication between the host and MCP servers. Each client connects to a specific server, ensuring secure and isolated interactions.
3. **MCP Servers**: External programs that implement the MCP standard, providing specific capabilities or data to the AI application
